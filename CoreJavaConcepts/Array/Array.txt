## Java Arrays:
Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory location.
Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location.
 It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on.
Unlike C/C++, we can get the length of the array using the length member. In C/C++, we need to use the sizeof operator.

#Advantages:
Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.
Disadvantages
Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.

Types of Array in java

There are two types of array.

Single Dimensional Array
Multidimensional Array
