# Static Binding and Dynamic Binding:
Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.

There are two types of binding

1) Static Binding (also known as Early Binding).:When type of object is determined at compile time then its Static binding.
2) Dynamic Binding (also known as Late Binding):and when it's at run-time then dynamic binding.

Understanding Type:

1) variables have a type:
Each variable has a type, it may be primitive and non-primitive.
eg.int data=30
2) References have a type
eg.class Dog{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  Dog d1;//Here d1 is a type of Dog  
 }  
} 
3) Objects have a type
An object is an instance of particular java class,but it is also an 
instance of its superclass.
ex.
class Animal{}  
  
class Dog extends Animal{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  Dog d1=new Dog();  
 }  
}  

Here d1 is an instance of Dog class, but it is also an instance of Animal.

# static binding:
When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as static binding.
If there is any private, final or static method in a class, there is static binding.

Dynamic binding
When type of the object is determined at run-time, it is known as dynamic binding.

class Animal{  
 void eat(){System.out.println("animal is eating...");}  
}  
  
class Dog extends Animal{  
 void eat(){System.out.println("dog is eating...");}  
  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
  Animal a=new Dog();  
  a.eat();  
 }  
}  
Test it Now
Output:dog is eating...
In the above example object type cannot be determined by the compiler, because the instance of Dog is also an instance of Animal.So compiler doesn't know its type, only its base type.
